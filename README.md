# tdd-practices
A collection of taks and practices to learn TDD. I do a commit for each session. each commit contains learning materials, done tasks and open questions.

## First Session
-
-

### tasks
- select your language and pragrammung method
- select your tools: testing framework/ runner/ ide plugins and ...
- implement two sample of kata. try to write tests for them after implementation and see if these tests can help you refactor your code.

## Second Session
- We practiced how to define domain entities in a tdd manner(in OOP context using xunit practices).
- We wrote tdd unit test and each time we had a failure through test, we stopped writing tests and implement the code to reach greem status again
- Important Note: **We write just the neessary code to reach green status. Refactoring comes later. **
- The goal was to write unit tests which are Trustworthyness(should not be failed becaues of any not related exception!) and Maintainability(you dont need to modify your test again and again).

### tasks
- Apply tdd task on the code you wrote last time from kata 
- Read about - happy path ---> naming convetnion ---> should_ philosophy
- Define same domain entity(city) in the context of your language(Node/ javascript) and method(OOP/ functional). The tests <ou define should be trustworthyness and Maintainability.

- fluent assertion for javascript(jest)
- Read about wallaby
- make sure your test  --> trustworthyness
- is it possible for jest watcher or wallaby to just watch a specific path?
- tdd rules for OOP vs tdd rules for functional programming
- unit testing naming convention
- build design pattern

## Learning Materials
- speciafication by example
- bdd
- clean architecture
- xunit
