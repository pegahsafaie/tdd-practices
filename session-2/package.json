  "description": "- We practiced how to define domain entities in a tdd manner(in OOP context using xunit practices).\r - We wrote tdd unit test and each time we had a failure through test, we stopped writing tests and implement the code to reach greem status again\r - Important Note: **We write just the neessary code to reach green status. Refactoring comes later. **\r - The goal was to write unit tests which are Trustworthyness(should not be failed becaues of any not related exception!) and Maintainability(you dont need to modify your test again and again).",
